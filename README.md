# MYOB hackday - Hero Song

This repository is the result of two days a cobbling together a project for our company's hack day.

Hero song is a Raspberry Pi based project that senses when your collegues walk into the office and plays them their favourite song.

The project uses a ASP.NET core web portal to allow people to register for the service. A Raspberry Pi senses people waling into the office by the Bluetooth radio in their phones.

Their song is then streamed from spotify.
